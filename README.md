# Project3
 Our group focused on the data engineering side and looked at video games. We used two datasets with MongoDb; followed by data cleaning. We used an interactive web site to show performance data regarding various game titles showing sales, release date and ratings. There are also visualizations showing some conclusions about the data. The examples for the website are on the website and are very user friendly.
 
 The main ethical concerns in this project were not extremely outstanding. That being said we mainly tried to avoided bias in data sets by generally being comprehensive, and using the best data sources we could find. Considering the data is a bit subjective and is in a way just showing people's bias towards which game they enjoyed most. Personal bias is how one would rate a game, so that isnt too much of a worry.
